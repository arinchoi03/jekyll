### Caveat

These are just some of my personal thoughts about my application and what led to the acceptance. Since there aren’t many blog posts out there about the experience at GHA (since it’s a new program at this time, just a year old), I decided I should give it a try. I can’t promise that everyone’s application process will be the same (I’m only one person after all), but I hope it helps somebody.

Just as a background, I’m a girl that’s as far removed from programming as you might imagine. I loved language arts/literature and history classes as a child and still enjoy reading books and love the stories about the days gone by. Maybe if I’d been terrible at school except in the arts, I’d have gone down a completely different path. However, I was pretty good at math and sciences as well - not like genius level, but enough to get 5′s on AP tests and get high scores on SAT/GRE maths. I decided I was going to be a doctor (ha ha) and graduated with a Biology degree. During my undergrad, I realized I didn’t really want to be a doctor (I also had low level of perseverance during my early 20s) and changed my path toward Forensics. I went to Master’s program in Forensic Science, which I think did help to get my foot in the door, and long story short- became a forensic scientist.

After four years in the field, I do have to say that I did and still do love the field of forensic biology and DNA testing. This part is honestly the hardest part for me to let go of in switching careers and jumping into the unknown. My husband had some background in engineering and a huge interest in programming world (he’s not a programmer though), and just planted the seed in my head that I could try doing something different, exciting, and innovative. Personal reasons for why I chose to change is: 1) flexibility and versatility of a web developer career, 2) exploring the full potential of what I could learn and BE, 3) higher pay/better benefits obviously with innovative, motivated people and 4) that I love problem solving to help others/myself continually improve (aka obnoxious overachiever).

### Researching

I researched quite a bit and actually applied to AppAcademy and Grace Hopper. I did get conditionally accepted into AppAcademy (~5-6 months before I applied to Grace Hopper) but wasn’t able to commit enough time/effort into it at the time. I think I was very overwhelmed by the new strange world of github and instructions about setting up my mac for all the additional work I had to complete before the next coding challenge interview. On top of full-time work (and when I work, I work 120% at least). So I respectfully let go of the conditional acceptance.

When I heard about this women-only programming bootcamp, the idea suddenly became so much more palatable than the a/A. The interview process was also much friendlier at GHA. The slack office hours at a/A intimidated me rather than helped me, because the questions being asked there were so much further ahead than anything I had understood so far…but GHA offers a TA dedicated to three students in Foundations, and if you’re falling behind in foundations, you’re required to have a one-on-one with the TA until you get the work done. I love that support! All in all, I do keep reading great things about AppAcademy though (very selective 5% admission, ~98% graduates hired), and maybe if I was at a better place in my life in that time, I would’ve stuck with it and gotten through it somehow. But I am just thrilled by GHA at this moment!

Both of these are tuition-deferred schools, which is great for me because I wasn’t ready to commit 10k+ up front if I don’t eventually get a dev job after the program.

### Application (December 4th/Accidentally submitted)

1. The on-line application was pretty easy to complete. The first part requires the resume and test scores (either SATs/GREs).
2. Second part was more of open-ended questions about why you’re interested in program, why do you think you’ll be a good student, etc
3. I wanted to take some time to answer these questions but didn’t have time to flesh out the answers, so I was going to come back to my admissions later, but I found out to my dismay the application had been submitted…but I did get invited to schedule my coding challenge on December 5th.

### Timed Coding Challenge (December 8th)
1. I prepped by doing the Codewars 8kyu, 7kyu, and couple 6kyu problems & doing 80% of Codeacademy Javascript tracks according to the recommendations on GHA website (and Fullstack Academy website).
2. There were five problems, beginning with a pretty easy problem and working up to the toughest fifth one. I couldn’t answer the last question, but understood the general idea of what had to be done to solve the problem, so I just wrote that in the comments and submitted it.
3. They give you 75 minutes to complete it and I took ALL 75 minutes.
4. I did sort of panic at first…but thinking about the problems soon took over the nerves.
5. I got a email saying they want to interview me on December 9th! I really appreciated their fast turnaround time.

### Live Coding Challenge/Interview (December 19th)
1. First of all, this was the best interview that I could’ve ever had! My interviewer Elisabeth was very patient and easy to talk to.
For what to expect, you can read this website. It is exactly as it is described.
2. The coding challenge was harder, but I was very comfortable in asking my interviewer questions to see how I could progress, communicated when I was lost/confused, and also did my best to demonstrate what I did know and what I thought should be done (even though 3. I may not be able to find the right syntax/methods at the time).
4. In the end we got the problems (two total) to work. I did contact Elisabeth later so I could look over the problems and learn the concepts behind them for the future.
5. Although I felt like I totally failed the problem-solving part, I came away with a great experience of learning from a compassionate and talented teacher. This is what I’m looking forward to the most at GHA this February…the positive collaborative learning environment!

### Acceptance Email! (December 21st) & Acceptance Call (December 27th)
1. Because I was spoiled by the quick turnaround time of GHA, I was hoping to hear from them on December 20th…however, they responded the day after that with a warm welcome from the Fullstack Admissions team. They said my admission was valid for any future cohort at Fullstack if I wished. Of course, I am going to stick with GHA :)
2. I scheduled a phone call conference with Shanna Gregory, the Dean of Grace Hopper.
3. She said I could opt for a later cohort if I had any issues with starting in February - but I really wanted to start early, now that I’ve switched tracks already. It’s good to know they offer that flexibility, though!
4. The call was about 15 minutes, I didn’t really have more questions left at this point because I had attended their webinar and asked many questions to Elisabeth as well during the interview. I did confirm that their hiring outcomes were similar to the ones advertised by Fullstack Academy.
5. Deposit ($3000) is due in a week and I can’t wait to start my prepwork :)
6. In the meantime, it’s back to [codewars](http://codewars.com/)  and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) for me…Foundations starts January 27th. Hope I can keep this studying going! (I’ve been studying 2-3 hours every night) I’ll be documenting as I go,…
